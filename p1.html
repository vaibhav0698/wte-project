Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
To fetch a pail of water.<br>
Jack fell down and broke his crown,<br>
And Jill came tumbling after.<br>
Then up got Jack and said to Jill,<br>
As in his arms he took her,<br>
Brush off that dirt for you're not hurt,<br>
Let's fetch that pail of water.<br>
So Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
To fetch the pail of water,<br>
And took it home to Mother dear,<br>
Who thanked her son and daughter.<br>
