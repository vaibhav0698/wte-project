The need is always there<br>
For someone sweet and fair<br>
Thankfully for me<br>
That's my mummy<br>
Who I love without compare.<br>

When I need a helping hand<br>
and just can't understand<br>
one person springs to mind<br>
my mother sweet and kind<br>

I want to say<br>
I love you mum<br>
and when I'm glum<br>
I know you'll make<br>
me feel it's no big deal.<br>

I cannot think of any one<br>
more giving than my mum<br>
you have my love forever.<br>
