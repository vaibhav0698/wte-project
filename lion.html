Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, a little mouse began running up and down on him.<br> This soon awakened the lion, who placed his huge paw on the mouse, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.<br>

"Pardon, O King!" cried the little mouse.<br> "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness.<br> And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!”<br>

The lion was so tickled by the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go.<br>

Sometime later, a few hunters captured the lion, and tied him to a tree. After that they went in search of a wagon, to take him to the zoo.<br>

Short StoriesJust then the little mouse happened to pass by. <br>On seeing the lion’s plight, he ran up to him and gnawed away the ropes that bound him, the king of the jungle.<br>

"Was I not right?" said the little mouse, very happy to help the lion. <br>
