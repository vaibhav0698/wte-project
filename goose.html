Once upon a time, a man and his wife had the good fortune to have a goose which laid a golden egg every day. <br>Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough.<br>

They imagined that if the bird is able to lay golden eggs, its insides must be made of gold. <br>And they thought that if they could get all that precious metal at once, they would get mighty rich very soon.<br> So the man and his wife decided to kill the bird.<br>
